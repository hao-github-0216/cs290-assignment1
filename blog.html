  <h2>Assignment 1 Reflection - Sept 30, 2025</h2>
  <p>
    At first, I had some trouble cloning the GitHub repository because of SSH key issues. 
    After checking my settings and search on the internet, I solved it.  
    In this assignment, I learned how to create simple HTML pages and push them to GitHub.  
    The most helpful resources were the Ed forum and GitHub documentation.
